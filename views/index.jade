      h2 Our Story
      p As many of you already know, Mike and I met through an online dating site in August of 2010 and those that know me might be surprised to hear that I made the first contact.  When Mike finally responded I could not have been more excited.  Throughout the next few weeks we used the opportunity to get to know each other and by the end of September he asked me out on our first date to a Royal’s baseball game.  My first thought was “I sure hope this goes well, because if not it is going to be one long first date sitting through an 9 inning baseball game.”  Needless to say to date went great.  Mike continued to impress me with his thoughtfulness, creativity and not to mention his sushi making skills.  It did not take long for us both to realize that we had found something special.
      p We spent the next two years of our lives getting to know each other and falling more in love each and every day.  In the fall of 2012 Mike made plans for us to take our dog Freckles for a walk in a nearby park.  I knew immediately that he had something up his sleeve.  As we were walking through the park I kept waiting for him to pop the question; however, to my surprise it never happened.  So the very next week (on October 23) when Mike asked if I wanted to go back to the park for a walk and fall picnic I did not think too much about it.   Right before I was getting ready to sit to enjoy our picnic, Mike got down on one knee and proposed.
      p We truly could not be happier and we look forward to the day in which we will start the rest of our lives together as husband and wife.  The only thing that could make this day more special is to be able to share this moment in our lives with our friends and family.
